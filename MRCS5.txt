MA001=~h~Tommy, you did a great job with the tasks I gave you.
MA002=~h~You have proven that you are the one we need. It's time to tell you... Let's go for a walk.
MA004=~h~I know this may sound crazy, but you have to believe me...
MA005=~h~Over the past few decades, the US government has been conducting covert research into bioengineering and cloning technologies.
MA006=~h~Last year, at "Area 69" in San Andreas, the "Zobmotech Corp.", together with military scientists, developed and built the world's first legion of fully autonomous clone-agents.
MA007=~h~Their bodies were created from a substance called "Green Goo", and their minds were controlled by artificial intelligence.
MA008=~h~We called it "The Dark Clan". Perfect soldiers.
MA009=~h~But as always happens, something went wrong; the technology for training and developing AI turned out to be too uncontrollable...
MA010=~h~...clones gained their own consciousness and escaped.
MA011=~h~The project was immediately canceled and funding stopped.
MA012=~h~It's unknown what to expect from them, so the government ordered the elimination of all clones.
MA013=~h~We could not involve the army - it's unacceptable to create panic among the civilians...
MA014=~h~And then it was decided to form several task forces led by the best CIA agents to search and destroy the clones. And I am one of these agents.
MA015=~h~Clone activity was also detected in Vice City, so I was sent here to find out and deal with it.
MA016=~h~Working as a secretary is just a cover, through the local network I monitor suspicious activity and try to figure out the location of the clones...
MA017=~h~...then my team and I go and destroy them.
MA018=~h~Man.. I don't even know what to say about this...
MA019=~h~...CIA, secret government developments, the clone army?...
MA020=~h~I'll show you. Let's go.
MA021=~h~I know you can fly things like this.
MA022=~h~Looks like you know a lot about me...
MA023=~h~Head to Washington Beach.
MA031=~h~Why are you telling me all this?
MA032=~h~You showed yourself well, we need people like you. The government will reward you generously.
MA033=~h~What if I spill the beans about this to someone?
MA034=~h~Hah... Then I'm allowed to eliminate you.
MA035=~h~So how did you end up on that pier?
MA036=~h~We discovered several clones near Vice Port and went after them...
MA037=~h~...but the bastards gave us a warm welcome.
MA038=~h~I lost two of my teammates...
MA039=~h~...but then I met you.
MA040=~h~I immediately noticed that you have potential.
MA041=~h~I guess this chopper is not civilian, it wasn't outside when we went for a walk....
MA042=~h~It's a gift from the guys from Fort Baxter Air Base.
MA043=~h~This bird has a .50 caliber machine gun mounted below its fuselage. Great for hunting clones.
MA051=~h~Damn, there's a whole fleet of armed men there!
MA052=~h~Don't panic! Press the red button and open fire!
MA053=~h~This was the last one!
MA054=~h~Look, there's a plane loaded with explosives! I have an idea! Land the chopper next to him!
MA056=~h~Great, the plane is all ours and load with bombs!
MA057=~h~I'll scout the Dark Clan positions and radio them to you.
MA058=~h~Let's bomb the bastards from the sky!
MA061=~h~Tommy, they have a whole fleet of cars in a multi-story parking lot in Ocean Beach!
MA062=~h~Blow up all their cars!
MA063=~h~Great! I see those boats that attacked my team at the Vice Port! Destroy them all!
MA064=~h~More vehicles in Vice Port! Be careful not to hit the passenger bus!
MA065=~h~I've spotted some moving targets on the golf course north of here!
MA071=~h~Excellent Tommy! Mission accomplished!
MA072=~h~The money has been transferred to your account. See you later at my office!
